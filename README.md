# Evaluating a Machine Learning Algorithm
> ### A TOOL BOX - ‘WHAT TO TRY NEXT?’

## Overview
With abundance of easy-to-use ML Libraries available, it is often appealing to apply them and achieve greater than 80% prediction accuracy in most cases. But, **‘WHAT TO TRY NEXT?’** is a question that buzz me, and may be other aspiring Data Scientists, a lot.
<br />
<br />
During my course **‘Machine Learning – Stanford Online’** at Coursera, **Prof. Andrew Ng** helped me sail through it. I hope this article, which briefs his explanation during one of his lectures, will help many of us to understand the importance of ‘debugging or diagnosing a learning algorithm’.

This notebook, ,promises to create a TOOL BOX - ‘WHAT TO TRY NEXT?’ which, along with Validation and Learning Curves, will help to make smart decisions.
